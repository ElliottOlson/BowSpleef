# BowSpleef

BowSpleef is a Minecraft minigame where the floor is made out of TNT, and you can shoot the floor with bows and arrows so that it drops down. The objective is to shoot the TNT and cause your opponents to fall into the void.   

This project is currently being recoded from the ground up, therefore many features may either be incomplete or missing. Continue to use the previous repository until this catches up.
